# Bird_Song_Recognition

This is Prediction Model which identifies the bird by its sound.
First I did EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and FE (Feature Extraction) specifically tailored for audio files.
I have used libraries of Matplotlib, Seaborn, Librosa, Sklearn, Py-Torch to do EDA and FE. 
The complete lifecycle of ML model development, encompassing model creation, training, and evaluation. I used Neural networks, PyTorch, and ResNet architecture for the model execution.
